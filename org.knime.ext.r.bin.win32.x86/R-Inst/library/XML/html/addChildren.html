<h2>Add child nodes to an XML node</h2>


<h3>Description</h3>

<p>
This collection of functions
allow us to add, remove and replace children from an XML node
and also to and and remove attributes on an XML node.
These are generic functions that work on
both internal C-level <code>XMLInternalElementNode</code> objects
and regular R-level  <code>XMLNode</code> objects.
</p>
<p>
<code>addChildren</code> is similar to <code><a href="addNode.html">addNode</a></code>
and the two may be consolidated into a single generic
function and methods in the future.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre>
addChildren(node, ..., kids = list(...), at = NA, cdata = FALSE)
removeChildren(node, ..., kids = list(...), free = FALSE)
removeNodes(node, free = rep(FALSE, length(node)))
replaceNodes(oldNode, newNode, ...)
addAttributes(node, ..., .attrs = NULL, 
                suppressNamespaceWarning = getOption("suppressXMLNamespaceWarning", FALSE))
removeAttributes(node, ..., .attrs = NULL, .namespace = FALSE,
                  .all = (length(list(...)) + length(.attrs)) == 0)
</pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table summary="R argblock">
<tr valign="top"><td><code>node</code></td>
<td>
the XML node whose state is to be modified,
i.e. to which the child nodes are to be added or whose attribute list
is to be changed.</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td><code>...</code></td>
<td>
This is for use in interactive settings when specifying a collection of
values individuall. In programming contexts when one obtains the
collection as a vector or list from another call, use the
<code>kids</code> or <code>.attrs</code> parameter.
</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td><code>kids</code></td>
<td>
when adding children to a node, this is a list of
children nodes which should be of
the same "type" (i.e. internal or R-level nodes)
as the <code>node</code> argument. However, they can also be
regular strings in which case they are converted to
XML text nodes.
<br>
For <code>removeChildren</code>, this is again a list
which identifies the child nodes to be
removed using 
the integer identifier of the child, or
the name of the XML node (but this will only remove the first such
node and not necessarily do what you expect when there are
multiple nodes with the same name),
or the <code>XMLInternalNode</code> object itself.
</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td><code>at</code></td>
<td>
if specified, an integer identifying
the position in the original
list of children at which the new children should be added.
The children are added after that child.
This can also be a vector of indices which is as long
as the number of children being added and specifies the position
for each child being added. If the vector is shorter than the
number of children being added, it is padded with NAs
and so the corresponding children are added at the end of the
list.
<br>
This parameter is only implemented for internal nodes at present.
</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td><code>cdata</code></td>
<td>
a logical value which controls whether children that
are specified as strings/text are enclosed within a CDATA node
when converted to actual nodes.  This value is passed on to the
relevant function that creates the text nodes, e.g. 
<code><a href="xmlNode.html">xmlTextNode</a></code> and <code><a href="newXMLDoc.html">newXMLTextNode</a></code>.
</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td><code>.attrs</code></td>
<td>
a character vector identifying the names of the
attributes.  These strings can have name space prefixes,
e.g. <code>r:length</code>
and the namespaces will be resolved relative to the
list supported by <code>node</code> to ensure those namespaces  are defined.
</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td><code>.namespace</code></td>
<td>
This is currently ignored and may never be
supported.
The intent is to identify on which set of attributes the operation is
to perform  - the name space declarations or the regular
node attributes.
This is a logical value indicating
if  <code>TRUE</code> that  the attributes of interested are name space declarations,
i.e. of the form <code>xmlns:prefix</code> or <code>xmlns</code>.
If a value of  <code>FALSE</code> is supplied this indicates that we
are identifying regular attributes.
Note that we can still identify attributes with a name space
prefix as, e.g., <code>ns:attr</code> without this value
</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td><code>free</code></td>
<td>
a logical value indicating whether to free the C-level
memory associated with the  child      nodes that were removed.
<code>TRUE</code> means to free that memory.
This is only applicable for the internal nodes created
with <code>xmlTree</code> and <code>newXMLNode</code> and related functions.
It is necessary as automated garbage collection is tricky in this
tree-based context spanning both R and C data structures and
memory managers. 
</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td><code>.all</code></td>
<td>
a logical value indicating whether to remove all of the
attributes within the XML node without having to specify them by
name.</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td><code>oldNode</code></td>
<td>
the node which is to be replaced</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td><code>newNode</code></td>
<td>
the node which is to take the place of
<code>oldNode</code> in the list of children of the parent of
<code>oldNode</code></td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td><code>suppressNamespaceWarning</code></td>
<td>
a logical value or a character string. 
This is used to control the situation when an  XML node
or attribute is created with a name space prefix that currently has no
definition for that node. 
This is not necessarily an error but can lead to one.
This argument controls whether a warning is issued
or if a separate function is called.
A value of <code>FALSE</code> means not to suppress the warning and 
so it is issued. A value of <code>TRUE</code> causes the potential
problem to be ignored assuming that the namespace will be added
to this node or one of its ancestors at a later point.
And if this value is a character string, we search for a
function of that name and invoke it. 
</td></tr>

<h3>Value</h3>

<p>
Each of these functions returns the modified node.
For an internal node, this is the same R object   and
only the C-level data structures have changed.
For an R <code>XMLNode</code> object, this is is an entirely
separate object from the original node.
It must be inserted back into its parent "node" or context if the changes are to be
seen in that wider context.</p>
