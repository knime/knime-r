Changes to Version 2.0.0

       o 'alr3' now formally depends on 'car'.

       o Most functions were rewritten, and almost all have been moved to
the 'car' package with slightly different names.  Old function names
continue to work calling the new function in 'car'. The exception is the
'bcpower' function in the old 'alr3', which has been superceded by the new
'powerTransform' function in 'car', but with different arguments.

       o All data sets remain in 'alr3'.  In some cases, variable names have
become row labels rather than a variable.  The 'longley' data was been
removed, as it is in the 'datasets' package in base R.  The 'forbes' data in
the 'alr3' package has one additional column with rounded logarithms of one
of the base variables, and is otherwise identical to the 'forbes' data in
the MASS package.
