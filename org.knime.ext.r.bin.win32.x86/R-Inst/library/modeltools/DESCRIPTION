Description: A collection of tools to deal with statistical models.
        The functionality is experimental and the user interface is
        likely to change in the future. The documentation is rather
        terse, but packages `coin' and `party' have some working
        examples. However, if you find the implemented ideas
        interesting we would be very interested in a discussion of this
        proposal. Contributions are more than welcome!
