Description: Basic infrastructure and some algorithms for the traveling
        salesperson problem (also traveling salesman problem; TSP).
        The package provides some simple algorithms and an interface to
        Concorde, the currently fastest TSP solver. Concorde itself is
        not included in the package and has to be obtained separately.
