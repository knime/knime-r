<h2>Is an Object from a Class</h2>


<h3>Description</h3>

<p>
<code>is</code>:
With two arguments, tests whether <code>object</code> can be treated as from
<code>class2</code>.
</p>
<p>
With one argument, returns all the super-classes of this object's class.
</p>
<p>
<code>extends</code>:
Does the first class extend the second class?
Returns <code>maybe</code> if the extension includes a test.
</p>
<p>
<code>setIs</code>:
Defines <code>class1</code> to be an extension of <code>class2</code>.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre>
is(object, class2)

extends(class1, class2, maybe=TRUE, fullInfo = FALSE)

setIs(class1, class2, test=NULL, coerce=NULL, replace=NULL,
      by = character(), where = topenv(parent.frame()), classDef =,
      extensionObject = NULL, doComplete = TRUE)
</pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table summary="R argblock">
<tr valign="top"><td><code>object</code></td>
<td>
any <font face="Courier New,Courier" color="#666666"><b>R</b></font> object.</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td><code>class1, class2</code></td>
<td>
the names of the classes between which <code>is</code> relations are to be
defined.</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td><code>maybe, fullInfo</code></td>
<td>
In a call to <code>extends</code>, <code>maybe</code> is a flag to
include/exclude conditional relations, and <code>fullInfo</code> is a
flag, which if <code>TRUE</code> causes object(s) of class
<code>classExtension</code> to be returned, rather than just the
names of the classes or a logical value.  See the details
below.</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td><code>extensionObject</code></td>
<td>
alternative to the <code>test, coerce,
    replace, by</code> arguments; an object from class
<code>SClassExtension</code> describing the relation.  (Used in internal calls.)
</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td><code>doComplete</code></td>
<td>
when <code>TRUE</code>, the class definitions will be
augmented with indirect relations as well.  (Used in internal calls.)</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td><code>test, coerce, replace</code></td>
<td>
In a call to <code>setIs</code>, functions optionally supplied to test whether the relation is
defined, to coerce the object to <code>class2</code>, and to alter the
object so that <code>is(object, class2)</code> is identical to
<code>value</code>.</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td><code>by</code></td>
<td>
In a call to <code>setIs</code>, the name of an intermediary class.  Coercion will proceed by first
coercing to this class and from there to the target class.  (The
intermediate coercions have to be valid.)</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td><code>where</code></td>
<td>
In a call to <code>setIs</code>, where to store the metadata defining the relationship. Default is
the global environment.</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td><code>classDef</code></td>
<td>
Optional class definition for <code>class</code> , required internally
when <code>setIs</code> is called during the initial definition of the
class by a call to <code><a href="setClass.html">setClass</a></code>. <EM>Don't</EM> use this
argument, unless you really know why you're doing so.</td></tr>

<h3>Details</h3>

<dl>
<dt><code>extends</code>:</dt><dd></p>
<p>
Given two class names, <code>extends</code> by default says whether the
first class extends the second; that is, it does for class names
what <code>is</code> does for an object and a class.  Given one class
name, it returns all the classes that class extends (the
&lsquo;superclasses&rsquo; of that class), including the class itself.  If
the flag <code>fullInfo</code> is <code>TRUE</code>, the result is a list, each
element of which is an object describing the relationship;
otherwise, and by default, the value returned is only the names of
the classes.</dd>


<dt><code>setIs</code>: </dt><dd></p>
<p>
This function establishes an inheritance relation between two
classes, by some means other than having one class contain the
other.  It should <EM>not</EM> be used for ordinary relationships:
either include the second class in the <code>contains=</code> argument
to <code><a href="setClass.html">setClass</a></code> if the class is contained in the usual
way, or consider <code>setClassUnion</code> to define a virtual class
that is extended by several ordinary classes.  A call to
<code>setIs</code> makes sense, for example, if one class ought to be
automatically convertible into a second class, but they have
different representations, so that the conversion must be done by
an explicit computation, not just be inheriting slots, for
example.  In this case, you will typically need to provide both a
<code>coerce=</code> and <code>replace=</code> argument to <code>setIs</code>.
</p>
<p>
The <code>coerce</code>, <code>replace</code>, and <code>by</code> arguments behave as
described for the <code><a href="as.html">setAs</a></code> function.  It's unlikely you
would use the <code>by</code> argument directly, but it is used in defining
cached information about classes.  The value returned (invisibly) by
<code>setIs</code> is the extension information, as a list.
</p>
<p>
The  <code>coerce</code> argument is a function that turns a
<code>class1</code> object into a <code>class2</code> object.  The
<code>replace</code> argument is a function of two arguments that modifies a <code>class1</code>
object (the first argument) to replace the part of it that
corresponds to <code>class2</code> (supplied as <code>value</code>, the second
argument).  It then returns the modified object as the value of the
call.  In other words, it acts as a replacement method to
implement the expression <code>as(object, class2) &lt;- value</code>.
</p>
<p>
The easiest way to think of the  <code>coerce</code> and <code>replace</code>
functions is by thinking of the case that  <code>class1</code>
contains <code>class2</code> in the usual sense, by including the slots of
the second class.  (To repeat, in this situation you would not call
<code>setIs</code>, but the analogy shows what happens when you do.)
</p>
<p>
The <code>coerce</code> function in this case would just make a
<code>class2</code> object by extracting the corresponding slots from the
<code>class1</code> object. The <code>replace</code> function would replace in
the <code>class1</code> object the slots corresponding to <code>class2</code>,
and return the modified object as its value.
</p>
<p>
The relationship can also be conditional, if a function is supplied as the
<code>test</code> argument.  This should be a function of one argument
that returns <code>TRUE</code> or <code>FALSE</code> according to whether the
object supplied satisfies the relation <code>is(object, class2)</code>.
If you worry about such things, conditional relations between
classes are slightly deprecated because they cannot be implemented
as efficiently as ordinary relations and because they sometimes can
lead to confusion (in thinking about what methods are dispatched for
a particular function, for example).  But they can correspond to
useful distinctions, such as when two classes have the same representation,
but only one of them obeys certain additional constraints.
</p>
<p>
Because only global environment information is saved, it rarely makes
sense to give a value other than the default for argument
<code>where</code>.  One exception is <code>where=0</code>, which modifies the
cached (i.e., session-scope) information about the class.  Class
completion computations use this version, but don't use it yourself
unless you are quite sure you know what you're doing.

<h3>References</h3>

<p>
The R package <span class="pkg">methods</span> implements, with a few exceptions, the
programming interface for classes and methods in the book
<EM>Programming with Data</EM> (John M. Chambers, Springer, 1998), in
particular sections 1.6, 2.7, 2.8, and chapters 7 and 8.
</p>
<p>
While the programming interface for the <span class="pkg">methods</span> package follows
the reference, the R software is an original implementation, so
details in the reference that reflect the S4 implementation may appear
differently in R.  Also, there are extensions to the programming
interface developed more recently than the reference.  For a
discussion of details see <code>?<a href="Methods.html">Methods</a></code>
and the links from that documentation.

<h3>Examples</h3>

<pre>

## a class definition (see <a href="setClass.html">setClass</a> for the example)
setClass("trackCurve",
         representation("track", smooth = "numeric"))
## A class similar to "trackCurve", but with different structure
## allowing matrices for the "y" and "smooth" slots
setClass("trackMultiCurve",
         representation(x="numeric", y="matrix", smooth="matrix"),
         prototype = structure(list(), x=numeric(), y=matrix(0,0,0),

                               smooth= matrix(0,0,0)))
## Automatically convert an object from class "trackCurve" into
## "trackMultiCurve", by making the y, smooth slots into 1-column matrices
setIs("trackCurve",
      "trackMultiCurve",
      coerce = function(obj) {
        new("trackMultiCurve",
            x = obj@x,
            y = as.matrix(obj@y),
            curve = as.matrix(obj@smooth))
      },
      replace = function(obj, value) {
        obj@y &lt;- as.matrix(value@y)
        obj@x &lt;- value@x
        obj@smooth &lt;- as.matrix(value@smooth)
        obj})

## Automatically convert the other way, but ONLY
## if the y data is one variable.
setIs("trackMultiCurve",
      "trackCurve",
      test = function(obj) {ncol(obj@y) == 1},
      coerce = function(obj) {
        new("trackCurve",
            x = slot(obj, "x"),
            y = as.numeric(obj@y),
            smooth = as.numeric(obj@smooth))
      },
      replace = function(obj, value) {
        obj@y &lt;- matrix(value@y, ncol=1)
        obj@x &lt;- value@x
        obj@smooth &lt;- value@smooth
        obj})
