		<intro>
			Shows a 2D R plot as a png view generated on an R Server. Select
		   two numeric columns, which are then displayed in the classic
		   x,y diagram. Missing values are supported, that is, missing
		   values in numeric columns are transfered as <tt>NaN</tt> (Not a 
		   Number) to the R server while missing values in all other types of 
		   columns are sent as <tt>NA</tt>.
			<p><b>R installation:</b><br/>
		    In order to get the R nodes running, you have to install the R-project 
		    first, see <a href="http://www.r-project.org">www.r-project.org</a>.
    	     Also the R Server which responds to R commands has to be installed 
    	     and running, see <a href="http://www.rosuda.org/Rserve">
    	     http://stats.math.uni-augsburg.de/Rserve</a><br/>. 
    	    Also make sure that you have the lastest available or compatible 
    	    R-project version at hand. For Windows you may download an R Server 
    	    for your R-project version. All other operating systems require the 
    	    most recent clients (R-project installation).
    	    We offer downloads of current 
    	    versions of R and R-Serve that are compatible with KNIME on our 
    	    website. Please note that in the current version the R Server needs
    	    to be restarted from time to time. If an R node hangs, interrupt 
    	    the R Server and restart it. Warnings and errors are printed in the
    	    R Server window.
