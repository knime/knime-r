	<shortDescription>

	    commands is returned in the output table of this node. The final result
	    table will have only one dimension, namely R.

		<intro>
			Allows execution of R commands on an R Server. The entire data 
			(compatible to int, double, and String types) is
			transfered to the R Server which then executes a series of R commands
			entered in the dialog. Each column can be accessed by the name provided
			in the input data table. The output has to be assigned to a variable
			named R. Missing values are not supported yet.
			<p><b>R installation:</b><br/>
		    In order to get the R nodes running, you have to install the R-project 
		    first, see <a href="http://www.r-project.org">www.r-project.org</a>.
    	     Also the R Server which responds to R commands has to be installed 
    	     and running, see <a href="http://stats.math.uni-augsburg.de/Rserve">
    	     http://stats.math.uni-augsburg.de/Rserve</a>. Please note that in the
		    current version the R Server needs to be restarted from time to time.
		    If an R node hangs, interrupt the R Server and restart it. Warnings
		    and errors are printed in the R Server window.
