		<intro>
		Allows execution of R command to build a R model in a local R 
		installation. The model is returned in the output port and can be used
		by the R Predictor node to predict unseen data. 
		All input data is written to a CSV file, imported into R 
		(saved in the variable named R) and processed together with the 
		R commands. The final model must be returned as variable called R.
