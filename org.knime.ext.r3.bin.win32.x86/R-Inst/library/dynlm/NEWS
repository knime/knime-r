Changes in Version 0.3-3

  o Streamlined Depends/Imports/Suggests. Now "dynlm" only depends on zoo
    but imports from stats, car, and lmtest. Packages datasets, strucchange,
    sandwich, and TSA are suggested (for use in examples).

  o Improved evaluation of pre-computed formulas (suggested by
    Vaidotas Zemlys).

  o Added tests/ with output from examples for R CMD check.


Changes in Version 0.3-2

  o Bug fix so that weights/offset can actually be used.


Changes in Version 0.3-1

  o Fixed bug in computation of R-squared values and Wald statistic
    for two-stage least squares.


Changes in Version 0.3-0

  o Added new formula functions trend() and harmon() that
    allow convenient specification of linear or cyclical
    patterns.


Changes in Version 0.2-3

  o Fixed bug when lagged variables are used in instrumental
    variables regression.


Changes in Version 0.2-2

  o Added CITATION file.


Changes in Version 0.2-1

  o Enhanced documentation ?dynlm.


Changes in Version 0.2-0

  o Added support for instrumental variables regression
    (two-stage least squares) via formulas like
      dynlm(y ~ x1 + x2 | z1 + z2 + z3, data = mydata)
    where z1, z2, z3 are the instruments.
  
  o Enabled specification of multiple lags via formulas like
      dynlm(y ~ L(x, 0:4), data = mydata)
    where y is regressed on x and lags 1 through 4 of x.

  o Fixed bug in time properties when there were leading
    NAs in the data.
