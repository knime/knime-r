Version 0.10.01.02
==================
Changes

	o	A new cut.mondate method
        -   Fashioned after a combination of cut.default and cut.Date
        -   Adheres to the "end-of-business-day" spirit of "mondate", but
            can be overridden with "right = FALSE"
        -   A-la cut.default, cut intervals are represented by 
            as left-open / right-closed
            *   include-lowest = TRUE by default. This ensures that the
                minimum value of the mondate is included in the first
                level. The first interval, therefore, is also left-closed.
                This is probably an issue only when breaks is a scalar.
        -   A-la cut.Date, allows the capability of an integer step when 
            breaks is "days", "weeks", "months", "quarters", or "years".
        -   Result has an optional "breaks" attribute = a mondate whose
            pairwise values determine a covering of the vector
            being cut. Most helpful when breaks = 
            "days", "weeks", "months", "quarters", or "years".
            Such "breaks" are suitable be use by 'hist'.
            Attribute is attached to the result by setting argument
            attr.breaks = TRUE (FALSE by default).
    o   New 'as.difftime' function to enable units 'months' and 'years'
        -   Now the difference between two mondate objects will be a 
            difftime object with units = timeunits of the first 
            mondate
    o   New + and - methods for mondate,difftime signatures to simplify
        adding and subtracting when the desired units (e.g.,"days") 
        is not "months" or "years".
        -   Example: mondate("2013-01-01")+difftime(1, units = "days")
    o   New 'add' and 'subtract' functions to return a date on the 
        same day of the month (subject to restrictions on the number 
        of days in a month), purposely violating the mondate 
        paradigm of measuring time in fractions of a month.
        Furthermore, the argument 'forcelastday' (default = FALSE)
        will guarantee that the result will be on the last day 
        of the month if the input 'mondate' value is.
        -   Examples: 
            *   add(mondate.ymd(2013, 1:12, 15), 1) will always
                result in a date on the 15th of the month.
            *   add(mondate.ymd(2013, 1:12, 15), 1, "days") yields
                mondates corresponding to the 16th of each month.
    o   A new "formatFUN" slot of the 'mondate' class
        -   The purpose of this slot is to allow for the user to define
            a special formatting function for converting mondate's to
            character. For example, there is no format string that 
            will format dates in terms of calendar quarter, but this
            can now be accomplished by specifying 'formatFUN' when
            the mondate is created.
        -   A function that will represent mondate's in YYYYQ* format,
            for * = 1-4, is exported in mondate's namespace under the
            name 'YearQuartersFormat'.
        -   The default value of formatFUN is NULL, in which case
            mondate uses the previous behavior -- i.e., formatting
            as a date according to the displayFormat of the mondate.
    o   A new "quarters" S3 method 
        -   Returns the "Q1 - Q3" representation of the calendar quarter 
            of the mondate. Same behavior as the quarters.Date method.
    o   A new "quarter" S4 generic with methods for mondate, Date, POSIXt
        -   Returns the numeric value of the calendar quarter.

Bug Fixes
    o   The default values for displayFormat (especially) and timeunits
        were not being set correctly on package load. As a result,
        the default displayFormat was always the international date standard
        even when the user's locale was in the United States.
        These values are now being determined at the time 
        a mondate instance is created.
        
Version 0.9.10.04
================
Changes
	o	year(), month(), day() functions have methods for Date and POSIXt objects.
	o   New "factor" signature for 'mondate' method converts factor to character
        then applies the "character" signature method.
    o   ymd() function retains names of argument if available

Version 0.9.10.01
================
Changes
	o	Replaced S4 methods cbind and rbind with functions cbindmondate and rbindmondate. This removed the two Internal calls in the package. As a result, the functionality is slightly changed:
		- Whereas mondate's and non-mondate's could previously be c/r-binded together with the result being a mondate, such a "mixed combination" now results in a data.frame. If necessary, non-mondates should be coerced to mondates ahead of time. 
		- When all the arguments are mondates, the result is a mondate as before.
		- The user will no longer see the message about the c/r-bind generics being created when the package is loaded.
		- Base c/r-bind with mondate arguments act on the Data slot of the mondates.

	o	The as.numeric method now assignes the names attribute of the mondate, if it exists. Before, only the dimnames attribute was assigned.


Version 0.9.9.01
================
Bug Fixes
   
================
NEW FEATURES
   o New 'as.mondate' function for coercing R objects to a mondate
================
Changes
   o Reverted any S4 method better implemented as S3 to an S3 version. 
	In particular, 'format' and 'unique' enable 'aggregate' to work
	with a mondate object specified in 'by' argument
   o Removed deprecated 'displayFormat' argument from as.character.mondate method
   o Clarified some of the documentation
