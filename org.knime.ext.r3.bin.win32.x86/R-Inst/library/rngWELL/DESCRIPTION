Description: It is a dedicated package to WELL pseudo random generators, which were introduced in Panneton et al. (2006), ``Improved Long-Period Generators Based on Linear Recurrences Modulo 2'', ACM Transactions on Mathematical Software. But this package is not intended to be used directly, you are strongly __encouraged__ to use the 'randtoolbox' package, which depends on this package.
