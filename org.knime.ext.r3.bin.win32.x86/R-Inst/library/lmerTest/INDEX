calcSatterth            F-test based on the Satterthwaite's
                        approximation for denominator degrees of
                        freedom.

difflsmeans             Calculates Differences of Least Squares Means
                        and Confidence Intervals for the factors of a
                        fixed part of mixed effects model of lmer
                        object.

lmer                    Fit Linear Mixed-Effects Models
lmerTest-package        The package performs different kinds of tests
                        on lmer objects, such as F tests of types I -
                        III hypotheses for the fixed part, likelihood
                        ratio tests for the random part, least squares
                        means (population means) and differences of
                        least squares means for the factors of the
                        fixed part with corresponding plots. The
                        package also provides with a function step,
                        that preforms backward elimination of
                        non-significant effects, starting from the
                        random effects, and then fixed ones.
lsmeans                 Calculates Least Squares Means and Confidence
                        Intervals for the factors of a fixed part of
                        mixed effects model of lmer object.
lsmeansLT               Calculates Least Squares Means and Confidence
                        Intervals for the factors of a fixed part of
                        mixed effects model of lmer object.
