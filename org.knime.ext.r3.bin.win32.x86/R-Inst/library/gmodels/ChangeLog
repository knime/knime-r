	* [r2058] R/ci.R, man/ci.Rd: ci.binom() was using an incorrect
	  method for calculating binomial confidence interval. The revised
	  code calculates the Clopper-Pearson 'exect' interval, which is
	  *conservative* due to the discrete nature of the binomial
	  distribution.

	  is more
	  descriptive and makes it easier to create and use methods for
	  other
	  classes, eg lme.
	  
	  - Enabled fit.contrast for lme object now that Doug Bates has

	  corrected values

	  statistical tests.
	* [r157] - Added explicit check to ensure that the number of
	  specified
	  contrasts is less than or equal to the ncol - 1. Previously, this
	  failed with an obtuse error message when the contrast matrix had
	  row
	  names, and silently dropped contrasts over ncol-1.

2002-11-04  warnes
