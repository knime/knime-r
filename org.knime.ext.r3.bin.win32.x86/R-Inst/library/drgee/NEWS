Changes in version 1.1.6 (2016-11-07)

o Added a helper function to obtain
  score residuals from clogit
  given the estimated coefficients,
  the observed outcomes,
  the design matrix
  and the id vector.

o Fixed a bug when using retrospective
  conditional logistic regression

o Add doubly robust estimation in
  conditional logistic models

Changes in version 1.1.5 (2016-04-25)

o Bugfixes

Changes in version 1.1.4 (2016-01-13)

o In some data manipulation steps, the data.table 
  package is used to obtain better speed.

o For estimation in conditional logistic models
  only outcome-discordant clusters are used

o Calculation of residuals for estimating equations
  for conditional logistic models implemented in C++
  using the Rcpp and RcppArmadillo packages. 

o Drops unused levels for factor variables

Changes in version 1.1.3 (2015-06-23)

o Fixed a bug in 'drgeeData' which caused an error
  when one of the nuisance models only contained an
  intercept

Changes in version 1.1.2 (2015-05-18)

o Fixed a bug in 'drgeeData' for the 'estimation.method'
  which happened when 'cond = TRUE' and 'olink = "logit"'.

Changes in version 1.1.1 (2015-05-09)

o Fixed a bug in 'drgeeData' that caused error when
  no data argument is supplied.

o There was an error in the previous version, when
  the function 'drgeeData' removed outcome concordant
  cluster for conditional methods. This is now corrected
  such that this only happens for conditional logistic
  methods.

Changes in version 1.1.0 (2015-04-20)

o The arguments 'outcome', 'exposure' and 'clusterid'
  can be supplied as vectors or as a string.

o Changed the interface for the 'drgee' function.
  Now the argument 'estimationMethod' has to be
  "dr","o", or "e" corresponding to previous choices
  "dr", "obe" and "ebe".
  When 'estimationMethod="o"', the user can supply an
  argument 'exposure' instead of 'emodel'. Similarly,
  when 'estimationMethod="e"', the user can supply an
  argument 'outcome' instead of 'omodel'.

o Changed the functions 'drgee' and 'gee' such
  that they always return the variance as a matrix.

o Added a function 'gee' which calculates all
  coefficients in a regression.

o Added an option 'cond' for 'drgee' and 'gee' for
  models with cluster-specific intercepts.

Changes in version 1.0.1 (2014-01-27)

o Fixed a bug in 'drFit'. The calculation of the
  Jacobian was incorrect for doubly robust estimation
  with outcome link logit, resulting in inconsistent
  estimates of standard errors. This bug is now fixed.


Changes in Version 1.0 (2013-12-19)

o First version released on CRAN
