Description: Basic infrastructure and some algorithms for the traveling
    salesperson problem (also traveling salesman problem; TSP). 
    The package provides some simple algorithms and
    an interface to Concorde, the currently fastest TSP solver. Concorde
    itself is not included in the package and has to be obtained separately.
