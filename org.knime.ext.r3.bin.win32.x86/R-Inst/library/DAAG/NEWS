                  Changes in DAAG version 1.19

NEW FEATURES
  o The function align2D() has been added.  This finds the linear 
    transformation which, applied to one set of points in the (x, y) 
    plane, gives the best match in a least squares sense to a second 
    set of points.
  o A bug in the function plotSimDiags() has been fixed.

BUG FIXES
  o The code for lmdiags() has been tidied.  


                  Changes in DAAG version 1.18
NEW FEATURES
  o The functionality of lmdiags(), called from plotSimDiags(),
    has been slightly improved.


                  Changes in DAAG version 1.17

NEW FEATURES
   o There are improvements to the way that dependencies are handled.
   o The file simulate-reg.pdf has been replaced by two knitr vignettes --
     'Functions for Assessing the Sampling Properties of plot.lm()
      Regression Diagnostics', and '{Functions that Demonstrate the
      Sampling Properties of Variable Selection'.


                 Changes in DAAG version 1.16

NEW FEATURES

    o The function plotSimScat was added.  This plots either residuals
      or y-variable simulated values, against the x-variable from a
      straight line regression.
    o The datasets tomato and bomregions2013 were added.
    o A pdf file simulate-reg.pdf has been placed in the subdirectory
      inst/doc.  This demonstrates the use of the functions
      plotSimDiags, plotSimScat and bsnVaryNvar.

BUG FIX

    o The NAMESPACE file has been edited to ensure that the function
      layer, used in plotSimDiags and plotSimScat, is taken from the
      latticeExtra package.

                  Changes in DAAG version 1.15

NEW FEATURES

    o The function plotSimDiags was added.  This returns diagnostics
      for multiple sets of simulated data.

                  Changes in DAAG version 1.14

NEW FEATURES

    o The function CVlm (alias cv.lm) has been modified to allow
      multiple explanatory variables.  Predicted values can be
      subtracted off from the points that are shown.  If there is
      more than one explanatory variable, the lines that are shown
      for individual folds are approximations to the small points
      that show the fitted values for the respective fold.
      Arguments main (main title) and legend.pos have been added.

                  Changes in DAAG version 1.13

NEW FUNCTIONS

    o the function bsnOpt has been added - this finds the regression
      model that is optimal according to the stated criteria

    o the functions bestsetNoise, bestset.noise, bsnCV, bsnOpt, and
      bsnVaryNvar all allow the optional logical argument intercept.
      Except for bsnVaryNvar, the user now has the option to supply
      arguments X and y.

    o the function lmdiags and the generic function plotSimDiags with
      a method for lm models have been added.  The function takes as
      argument a model object, then returning a lattice graphics object
      or objects that show regression diagnostics for simulated data

BUG FIX

    o In the dataset possumsites, the first two column names have been
      corrected to "Longitude" and "Latitude".  The code under 'Examples'
      has been changed accordingly, so that the map that appears is
      the same as before.
