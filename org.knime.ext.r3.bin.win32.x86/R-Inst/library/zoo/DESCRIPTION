Description: An S3 class with methods for totally ordered indexed
             observations. It is particularly aimed at irregular time series
             of numeric vectors/matrices and factors. zoo's key design goals
             are independence of a particular index/date/time class and
             consistency with ts and base R by providing methods to extend
             standard generics.
