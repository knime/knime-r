Version 0.8.0  (23 July 2012)
-------------
BRugs now works with an existing installation of OpenBUGS (>?)= 3.2.2.

modelSetWD is exported from the NAMESPACE

bugfixed to find examples on various Linux installations


Version 0.7.4, 0.7.5
--------------------
bugfix releases


Version 0.7.3  (02 January 2012)
-------------
BRugs now supports 64-bit R on Windows, using the same helper program
as Linux for calling the 32 bit OpenBUGS shared library.  Thanks to
Brian Ripley for the reports. This is typically slower than the more 
native interface used for 32-bit R on Windows.

On Linux, when the OpenBUGS library call terminates with a "trap"
error, the trap message is now shown.  Thanks to Alexandre Villers.
Though on Windows, OpenBUGS "traps" still crash R.

modelSetWD() function added. This is simply an alias for setwd(), for
compatibility with the OpenBUGS script function of the same name.

Just strip trailing spaces, not internal spaces, from updater names in
infoUpdatersbyName().  Thanks to Bob O'Hara.

samplesSize() gives a warning, and samplesBgr() now gives an error,
instead of crashing, when trying to use them when the sampler is in an
adaptive phase.

Warning in manual that enabling/disabling updaters is not supported on
Linux until the next version of OpenBUGS.

BugsCmd API function is now supported by BugsHelper, but this is not
used.

Some minor bug and documentation fixes.

First CRAN version for OpenBUGS 3.2.1.


Version 0.7.1  (19 April 2011)
-------------

The configure script on Linux now automatically detects OpenBUGS
installed by the RPM and DEB packages (to standards-compliant
locations) as well as OpenBUGS installed by the source package.

Bug fix - bugsData should accept data as a list of variable names.
Thanks to Brian Ripley for these reports.

handleRes() now explicitly labels internal OpenBUGS traps as bugs and
asks the user to send a bug report to the package maintainer.

On Windows, if OpenBUGS installation is not detected in the registry,
package loading continues with a warning instead of stopping with an
error.  If OpenBUGS was actually installed, the user can then load it
from a specified directory with loadOpenBUGS(dir).


Version 0.7  (March 2011)
-----------

BRugs now works with an existing installation of OpenBUGS (3.2.1 or
later) instead of being distributed with the OpenBUGS library.

On Windows, the OpenBUGS location is determined by a registry key
which is installed by the OpenBUGS for Windows installation program.

On Linux, the OpenBUGS shared library and documentation are assumed to
be installed together in a library directory.  Using the new OpenBUGS
for Linux source package OpenBUGS-3.2.1.tar.gz or later, this library
directory is by default

/usr/local/lib/OpenBUGS

In most cases it should be detected automatically when installing, but
it can be changed by running, for instance

R CMD INSTALL --configure-args='--with-openbugs=/usr/lib/OpenBUGS'



Version 0.61
------------
Fix for crash in bugsData


Version 0.6
-----------

Forked from the version of BRugs (0.5.3) available on CRAN Extras.
This new version supports Linux for the first time, as detailed below.


CHANGES MADE FOR LINUX PORT OF BRugs

* A C program called BugsHelper is used to call the OpenBUGS shared
  library on Linux via a system() call.  With one call of BugsHelper,
  any number of different OpenBUGS API commands can be run.  The state
  of the model is "internalized" on entry from a file in the temporary
  directory, and "externalized" on exit.  The source is in src/ and
  the binary is installed into exec/.

* New function .OpenBUGS() to execute a sequence of OpenBUGS API
  commands of possibly differing types (e.g. CmdInterpreter,
  RealArray, Integer) with given arguments.  On Windows, this is a
  wrapper for the old method of calling C functions from the
  dyn.load()-ed library.  On Linux, this calls BugsHelper once.  The
  old .CmdInterpreter and related functions still have the same
  interfaces, but work by calling .OpenBUGS().

* Input and output from the OpenBUGS API on Linux is performed through
  files input1.txt, output1.txt, input2.txt, output2.txt, ...  in the
  same /tmp/R*** directory as the buffer.txt file.  The buffer.txt
  file is used as before for messages from OpenBUGS.

* A set of global variables is stored in the options() list containing
  the begin and end iterations, first and last chains, thin interval
  and precision to calculate sample statistics.  This is required
  because the OpenBUGS Internalize / Externalize facility used by
  BugsHelper does not save these variables, which are normally stored
  in the OpenBUGS internal module SamplesEmbed.  They are not saved
  because OpenBUGS considers them to be part of the GUI state
  (equivalent to the values typed in Inference->Samples...) rather
  than the model state.  These variables are reset when a new model is
  checked and compiled.

* As a result, all functions which compute sample statistics must
  first call an API command which is returned by
  .SamplesGlobalsCmd(node).  This command updates the values stored in
  SamplesEmbed using the values stored in options().  This ensures
  that OpenBUGS knows about them before calculating sample statistics.
  (Note this is still done on Windows where it is not necessary, but
  there should be negligible overhead).  The directly affected
  functions are samplesCoda(), samplesSize(), samplesSample(),
  samplesStats(), samplesCorrel(), plotBgr().

* .onLoad() in zzz.R initialises these global variables on Linux and
  Windows.

* The corresponding set/get functions are changed to read and write
  these global variables instead of updating the values in
  SamplesEmbed.

* plotBGR() modified to use a single .OpenBUGS() call to return a list
  of samples for each required iteration on the grid.  bgrPoint()
  takes a sample instead of a node and iteration.  Using one
  .OpenBUGS() call for each sample would be an order of magnitude
  slower using the Linux helper program.  Assume the extra memory
  overhead, compared to the old method, is not a problem on Windows.

* infoNodeValues() and SetValues() now read and write the values from
  multiple chains, and work on scalars as well as vectors.

* modelNames() modified to use a single .OpenBUGS call instead of
  looping API commands over names in the model.

* useDynLib(BRugs) removed from NAMESPACE.  This is done in .OnLoad()
  instead, to ensure that it is only used on Windows.

* modelGetRN() removed, as the initial random number preset is not
  saved by the Externalize facility.  The random number state however
  is saved and restored properly during the model run.  There is no
  need for the initial preset to be read by the user, as it does not
  change as the model runs.

* samplesCorrel() wasn't setting begin/end/thin etc. properly, since
  the CorrelEmbed module doesn't use the values in SamplesEmbed.
  These are now read from the variables in options().

Update 0.5-3
- fix writeModel() again by going through parse tree now
- fix buildMCMC() to report right thinning parameters and keep all samples


Update 0.5-2
- added seed argument to BRugsFit()
- fix writeModel() to work for separatly specified function body
- fix writeModel() to make larger numeric (particularly integer) values
  in scientific notation work
