Title: A Fast Implementation of Random Forests
Version: 0.8.0
Date: 2017-06-19
Author: Marvin N. Wright
Maintainer: Marvin N. Wright <cran@wrig.de>
Description: A fast implementation of Random Forests, particularly suited for high
          dimensional data. Ensembles of classification, regression, survival and
          probability prediction trees are supported. Data from genome-wide association
          studies can be analyzed efficiently. In addition to data frames, datasets of
          class 'gwaa.data' (R package 'GenABEL') can be directly analyzed.
