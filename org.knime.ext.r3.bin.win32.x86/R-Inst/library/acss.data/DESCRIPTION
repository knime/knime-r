Description: Data only package providing the algorithmic complexity of short strings, computed using the coding theorem method. For a given set of symbols in a string, all possible or a large number of random samples of Turing machines (TM) with a given number of states (e.g., 5) and number of symbols corresponding to the number of symbols in the strings were simulated until they reached a halting state or failed to end. This package contains data on 4.5 million strings from length 1 to 12 simulated on TMs with 2, 4, 5, 6, and 9 symbols. The complexity of the string corresponds to the distribution of the halting states of the TMs.
