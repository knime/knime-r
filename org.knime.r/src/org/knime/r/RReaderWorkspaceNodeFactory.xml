    <shortDescription>
        A source node that reads data from R into KNIME.

    <fullDescription>
        <intro>
        A  node for reading diverse data sources from R into an R Workspace Port. 
		Use this when there are R functions that you want to use to read an exotic file into R but 
		need to branch your workspace in R before bringing it completely into KNIME. The R library 
		"foreign" provides support for some "exotic" data types.  Reasons for needing a workspace branch
		include the generation of multiple visualizations from a single data frame.

				environment flow variable from e.g. a
