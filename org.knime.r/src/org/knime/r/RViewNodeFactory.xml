            The code being executed in R.  Input data is available as a data frame named <i>knime.in</i>, 
			while the desired output image must be generated as an R view (eg. don't use the R function
			"png()" as this will likely result in a empty view).

				You can either specify the path directly or use the R installation in
				a conda environment. The conda environment can be specified using a conda
				environment flow variable from e.g. a
