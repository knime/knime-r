		  <option name ="R Script">
            The code being executed in R.  Input data is available as a data frame named <i>knime.in</i>, 
			while the desired output image must be generated as an R view (eg. don't use the R function
			"png()" as this will likely result in a empty view).
          </option>
          <option name="Flow Variable List">
            The list contains the flow variables that are currently available at
            the node input. Double clicking any of the entries will insert the
            variable at the current cursor position.
          </option>
          <option name="Column List">
            The list contains the column references that are currently available at
            the node input. Double clicking any of the entries will insert the
            respective identifier at the current cursor position.

	      <option name="Send Row Names to R">
	        Whether to send the row names from KNIME to R. Disabling this can improve performance with very large tables.
	        Row names of knime.in will instead be default R row names: 1:n.
	      </option>
	      <option name="R type for knime.in">
	        By default knime.in is data.frame. For large input tables, using data.table is likely more memory efficient
	        especially while sending the input data to R and may therefore be faster.

	        Please be aware that the <b>support for data.table is experimental (!)</b> and requires the "data.table" R package
	        to be installed. It may not work for some R scripts, may slightly change or even be removed entirely in a future version.
	      </option>
	      <option name="Send batch size">
	        The input of the R node is sent in row batches (default, 10 000 rows at a time). This is the amount of rows KNIME will
	        retain in memory at any given time. For large tables, a higher batch size may be faster, but will require additional
	        memory.
	        Be aware, that R will likely keep all of the input table in memory and this only helps with memory during transmission
	        of data to R.
