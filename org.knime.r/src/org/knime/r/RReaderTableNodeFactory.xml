        A source node that reads data from R into KNIME.

        <intro>
        A node for reading diverse data sources from R into a KNIME table. 
		Use this when there are R functions that you want to use to read an exotic file into KNIME.  
		The R library "foreign" provides some examples of such functionality.

            The list contains the flow variables that are currently available at

				Check this option to select a path to the home of a R installation

				The path must point to the root folder of the R installation tree.
				You can either specify the path directly or use the R installation in
				a conda environment. The conda environment can be specified using a conda
				environment flow variable from e.g. a
