            <p><b>Examples</b></p>
			<p>Take the input column "d", compute students t-test and store the p-value in the flow variable p.value:</p>
            <i>h &lt;- t.test(knime.in["d"])</i><br/>
			<i>knime.flow.out &lt;- list(p.value = h[["p.value"]])</i>
			 
            <p>Read the data from the file defined by the flow variable fname. The data
            object will be sent to the output:</p>

	      <option name="Send Row Names to R">
	        Whether to send the row names from KNIME to R. Disabling this can improve performance with very large tables.
	        Row names of knime.in will instead be default R row names: 1:n.
	      </option>
	      <option name="R type for knime.in">
	        By default knime.in is data.frame. For large input tables, using data.table is likely more memory efficient
	        especially while sending the input data to R and may therefore be faster.

	        Please be aware that the <b>support for data.table is experimental (!)</b> and requires the "data.table" R package
	        to be installed. It may not work for some R scripts, may slightly change or even be removed entirely in a future version.
	      </option>
	      <option name="Send batch size">
	        The input of the R node is sent in row batches (default, 10 000 rows at a time). This is the amount of rows KNIME will
	        retain in memory at any given time. For large tables, a higher batch size may be faster, but will require additional
	        memory.
	        Be aware, that R will likely keep all of the input table in memory and this only helps with memory during transmission
	        of data to R.
	      </option>
			<option name="Overwrite default path to R home">
				Check this option to select a path to the home of a R installation
				that is different from the path configured on the R preference page.
				The path must point to the root folder of the R installation tree.
				You can either specify the path directly or use the R installation in
				a conda environment. The conda environment can be specified using a conda
				environment flow variable from e.g. a
				<a href="https://kni.me/n/7HrPteTMsla4bZml">&#8220;Conda Environment Propagation&#8221; node.</a>
