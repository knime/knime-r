		  <option name ="R Script">
            The code being executed in R.  Input data is available as a data frame named <i>knime.in</i>, 
			while the desired output data must be generated as a data frame named <i>knime.out</i>. Code may
			be executed and re-executed within the script using the Evaluate Script and 
			Evaluate Selection commands respectively.

          <option name="Flow Variable List">
            The list contains the flow variables that are currently available at
            the node input. Double clicking any of the entries will insert the
            respective identifier at the current cursor position (replacing the
            selection, if any).
          </option>
          <option name="Column List">
            The list contains the column references that are currently available at
            the node input. Double clicking any of the entries will insert the
            respective identifier at the current cursor position.

	      <option name="NaNs">
	        Convert NaN and +/-Infinity output to missing cells. Enable this for backwards compatibility with the behavior before
	        version 2.10.
	      </option>
	      <option name="Send Row Names to R">
	        Whether to send the row names from KNIME to R. Disabling this can improve performance with very large tables.
	        Row names of knime.in will instead be default R row names: 1:n.
	      </option>
	      <option name="R type for knime.in">
	        By default knime.in is data.frame. For large input tables, using data.table is likely more memory efficient
	        especially while sending the input data to R and may therefore be faster.

	        Please be aware that the <b>support for data.table is experimental (!)</b> and requires the "data.table" R package
	        to be installed. It may not work for some R scripts, may slightly change or even be removed entirely in a future version.
	      </option>
	      <option name="Send batch size">
	        The input of the R node is sent in row batches (default, 10 000 rows at a time). This is the amount of rows KNIME will
	        retain in memory at any given time. For large tables, a higher batch size may be faster, but will require additional
	        memory.
	        Be aware, that R will likely keep all of the input table in memory and this only helps with memory during transmission
	        of data to R.
	      </option>
			<option name="Overwrite default path to R home">
				Check this option to select a path to the home of a R installation
				that is different from the path configured on the R preference page.
				The path must point to the root folder of the R installation tree.
				You can either specify the path directly or use the R installation in
				a conda environment. The conda environment can be specified using a conda
				environment flow variable from e.g. a
				<a href="https://kni.me/n/7HrPteTMsla4bZml">&#8220;Conda Environment Propagation&#8221; node.</a>
